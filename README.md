The transistor is BC337.
The temp. sensor is DS18B20.
In simple Web page you can see the measurement of temepratura in C and F.
To see the IP that ESP8266 is use, when you upload the .ino file open Serial Console from Arduino IDE to see the IP address than open your browser and type this IP address an you will  see the measurement of temperature.
